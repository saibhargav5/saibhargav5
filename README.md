## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AMBA Protocols verification using UVM

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UVM, Python and Computer Architecture

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DV or Computer Architecture Projects

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Performance Modelling Projects

ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about Design Verification, Computer Architecture and Silicon Validation(DFT)

ðŸ“« How to reach me: g.saibhargav5@gmail.com

âš¡ Fun fact: System Verilog is not only for Verification but also for Synthesizing.
